# solar-scale
Give a sense of scale to objects in our solar system. Objects size is proportional but the distances between objects is greatly reduced - as you would be scrolling for a long time otherwise.

[Live Demo](http://ThunderboltVRS.github.io/solar-scale/elm.html)

Use Keys A and D to move left and right. Use keys q and e to zoom in and out (not smoothed yet).
